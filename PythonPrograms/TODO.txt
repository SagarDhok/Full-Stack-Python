#!bitwise or ^ = truth table symmetric difference , swapping , regular expresiion searches except value

1 byte = 8 bits
8 byte = 64 bits


imp - program for searching all special symbols
     + symbol : addition, concatenation ,representing one or more occurrence of character   
     * multiplication , for repetation ,to represent 0 1 and more number of number of seaches in regular expresiion and also exponentiation 

mobile number validation in written test  can come


imp
unique - only can have one not null 
delete from employees works like truncate will delete all data 
delete vs truncate vs table
what is avg()
joins most imp

str_concate() - single detee
group_concate() - we can use without distinct but not without group by 
foreign key values must be in range of primary key 
left and righ join union = full join 


comman data = inner join
left side = left join
right side = right join
right join and left join are same

check is used when creating table and having is used while extracting data

procedures cannot return
function can rerutn in sql



table are directly created
table have indexes

views are created based on quores
view cannot have indexes


in mongodb the aggregation stages should be in sequence

grouping is most in imp only asked in mongodb  and lookup also

only left join is done in lookup

unwind takes an array and spilt that array in multiple way

_id is different of every document in mongodb
_ID TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT GROUP IN ONE LIKE MALE FEMALE OTHERS IN ONE SO _ID IS USED

$catogoty in group cause values of category will chanbe
$ FOR DYNAMIC VALUES


$OUT IS used in last stage
